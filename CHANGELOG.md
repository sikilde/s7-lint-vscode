# Changelog

All notable changes to S7 Lint for VS Code will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
Fixes for the README's known limitations

- `+` and `-` written without spaces are operators again: `4-1` and `#a-1`
  no longer lose the subtraction and report a missing semicolon, and such
  expressions are type-checked. Signed literals (`:= -1`, `Array[-5..-1]`,
  `int#-32768`), dates and exponents lex as before.
- A FUNCTION's result variable (its own name) has the declared return type,
  so assignments to it and conditions on it are checked like any other local
  variable.
- TIA-exported references such as `"DB_EdgeCaseDemo".#sString` are accepted
  alongside the equivalent unprefixed member spelling.
- XML exports keep their source lines. PLC data type, DATA_BLOCK and PLC tag
  declarations and their members report diagnostics and Go to Definition on
  their own line instead of line 1, also in CRLF files. Every block in a
  multi-block `.scl` file navigates to its own header.
- Type-cache diagnostics are shown for an XML PLC data type outside a
  `PLC data types` folder.
- The type cache and block index follow workspace changes incrementally: only
  the files involved are read again, a burst of file events is applied once,
  updates can no longer finish out of order, and folders deleted or moved in
  as a whole are picked up. Saving `system-types.yaml` in the Instruction
  Registry Editor no longer rescans the workspace.
- New settings, both off by default: `tiaLint.targetPlatform` reports declared
  data types the chosen CPU family doesn't support (from the now-loaded
  `platform-availability.yaml`), and `tiaLint.iecCheck` reports bit-string
  arithmetic as a block's IEC check would.

## 0.1.7
Bug fixes

Thanks to [@sikilde](https://github.com/sikilde) for reporting issues #1–#4
and contributing #5.

- `Date_And_Time` is accepted as a declaration datatype in every VAR section.
  TIA Portal exports it, but it was missing from the section-legality registry
  (#5, by [@sikilde](https://github.com/sikilde)).
- A `REGION` name is free text up to the end of its line, and a parenthesised
  `(/* ... */)` comment is recognised, so `REGION DESCRIPTION` followed by a
  multilingual comment no longer reports an unknown instruction (#1).
- Added a `repeat` pin keyword to the instruction registry for consecutively
  numbered parameters. SCL MIN/MAX accept IN3..IN32 and MUX/DEMUX IN2..IN31 /
  OUT2..OUT31; the graphical ADD, MUL, CALCULATE, MIN, MAX, AND, OR, XOR, MUX
  and DEMUX boxes accept their inserted inputs/outputs (#2).
- SCL parameter names are matched case-insensitively, as in TIA Portal, so
  `IN1 :=` against a registry `in1` no longer warns. The SCL string and
  date/time instructions now use TIA's upper-case parameter spelling in
  completion and hovers (#3).
- `STRING#'...'` and `WSTRING#'...'` typed constants are recognised, so
  `WSTRING#''` no longer reports `'#'` as an undeclared identifier (#4).

## 0.1.6
Bug fixes

- Added `.s7res` YAML/schema validation, detection of silent text loss from
  unquoted ` #`, duplicate-ID checks, and bidirectional MLC cross-references.

## 0.1.5

Editor intelligence and SCL semantic-highlighting improvements.

- Reworked semantic highlighting around SCL meaning while retaining ordinary
  VS Code theme compatibility. UDTs, DATA_BLOCK objects, callable types and
  instances, interface leaves, structured containers, and indexable values now
  have distinct, composable semantic roles. Built-in datatypes are grouped into
  temporal, integer/bit, boolean, floating-point, generic/reference, and text
  families to reduce visual noise.
- Added an automatically managed dark/light semantic palette. It activates for
  supported files, preserves unrelated and manually customized rules, migrates
  recognized older S7 Lint values, and can be disabled or restored with the
  **Disable/Install Recommended Semantic Colors** commands. High-contrast
  themes are left unchanged.
- Made dotted-access highlighting type-aware. Root DATA_BLOCKs retain their
  object identity; intermediate UDT/STRUCT members show container capability;
  arrays and strings show indexable capability; scalar leaves remain leaves.
  Bit selection such as `Flags.%X0` no longer incorrectly turns the scalar
  `Flags` value into a container.
- Added case-insensitive builtin/system-type hover lookup and richer UDT and
  DATA_BLOCK hovers. Siemens standard/non-optimized layout calculations now
  report total size, included padding, and every unknown-size dependency that
  prevents a safe calculation.
- Added storage details when hovering declaration names in UDT `STRUCT`,
  DATA_BLOCK `VAR`/outer `STRUCT`, and nested inline `STRUCT` sections. Hovers
  show declared type, member size, and container-relative offset, including
  packed `byte.bit` offsets for `BOOL` members and Siemens alignment for arrays,
  strings, nested structures, and referenced UDTs.
- Added rename support for workspace UDT declarations and case-insensitive
  quoted UDT references, including collision and builtin-name safeguards.
- Fixed datatype completion inside legal `STRUCT ... END_STRUCT` declaration
  bodies, including partially typed names such as `NewVar : B`, whitespace
  around `:`, and nested inline structures.
- Fixed completion requests becoming permanently incomplete/loading when an
  unfinished declaration produced the same suggestions repeatedly.
- Fixed global DATA_BLOCK `STRUCT` parsing and member resolution for mixed
  declaration forms.
- Preserved explicit `String[n]`/`WString[n]` capacities for layout calculation
  without weakening the existing rule that rejects sized strings as `REF_TO`
  targets.

## 0.1.4

Bug fixes.

## 0.1.3

Validated against a full, cleanly compiling S7-1500 project export (96 files).
Every diagnostic it produced was a false positive; this release removes all of
them. The two biggest causes were quoted identifiers and cross-file references.

Quoted names. Siemens quotes any identifier that isn't a legal bare one, and
the quoted spelling can appear wherever an identifier can. Each position was
its own defect, and each cascaded, because a walker that stopped at the quote
re-read the rest of the construct as something else:

- A quoted member in a dot chain (`"Db".Rec."1_Value"`) broke the chain, in the
  document index, the parser, and the syntax checker independently.
- A quoted formal parameter (`"1_Data" := ...`) fell through to the value path,
  where its own `:=` was then reported as an unexpected token.
- A quoted local tag (`#"Tag"`) lexes as two tokens; the base read as an empty
  `#`, and the name then matched the `"Block".member` external-reference shape,
  producing phantom missing-block reports and hiding the `#"Inst".Instr(...)`
  call shape entirely. A quoted name was also recorded twice, once correctly
  and once as an external reference, because the walking loop re-examined it.

Cross-file references:

- DATA_BLOCKs exported as XML are now indexed. TIA writes instance DBs in that
  format even when the FUNCTION_BLOCK they instance is text, so every reference
  to one previously resolved to nothing.
- XML exports are now discovered anywhere in the workspace. The scan was scoped
  to a `PLC data types/` folder, which a real export does not follow: DATA_BLOCK
  exports sit next to their own block, and UDT exports sit next to the code that
  uses them just as often. The narrow glob lost both -- instance DBs never
  reached the block index, and in one 96-file project 44 of the UDT exports
  never reached the type cache either.
- A LAD/FBD call to a workspace block (`"Some_DB"(...)`) is resolved against the
  workspace instead of the instruction registry, which was searched for the
  empty string and reported `Unknown instruction ''`.

Other syntax that was rejected but is valid:

- An array index on a chain member (`"Db".Units[1].Value`). This one cascaded
  worst: a single unconsumed `[` could produce hundreds of follow-on errors.
- A FUNCTION's result variable, addressed through the function's own name.
- `String[64]` and other explicit-length String/WString declarations.
- `EN`/`ENO`, which belong to the call rather than to the instruction and so
  are listed by no registry entry.
- An untyped integer constant against a bit string (`#someWord + 1`,
  `(#bits AND #mask) <> 0`). Such a constant has no domain of its own and takes
  the one its first operation gives it.
- Arithmetic on bit strings, which strict IEC rejects but TIA accepts unless a
  block's "IEC check" property is on -- a project setting no export carries.
- An instruction instance type in a `VAR_IN_OUT` section, which passes by
  reference rather than making the block own instance data.
- Any literal on a `Variant`/`Any`/`Pointer` pin: these are type-erased, so
  comparing a concrete type against them can only produce a false mismatch.

Registry corrections, all confirmed against the compiling project:

- `MB_CLIENT` required `MB_DATA_PTR` and the `RD_`/`WR_` pair simultaneously;
  they are alternative forms, so no call could satisfy all three.
- `PID_Compact`'s `Mode` is a retained InOut, not something a call must wire.
- The `POKE` family's parameter pins excluded the `L` memory area, so no block
  parameter could be passed to them. `PEEK_DWORD` had the same gap.

Retired `array-index-expression`. It claimed a variable expression is not a
legal array index; the compiling project uses such indices in several places.
The rule's own key names the LAD/FBD actual-parameter context it came from, and
the fixture cited as confirming it carried an unresolved "validate against TIA
compiler" caveat -- so the confirmation was circular. The fixture is now a
positive case, and both registries record the correction.

## 0.1.2

- Fixed typed and radix literals being misread as tag references. The lexer
  splits `<prefix>#<value>` across several tokens (`16#EFEF` becomes
  `16` + `#EFEF`), and the guard that told a literal tail from a real `#tag`
  only recognised a small set of letter prefixes, so `16#EFEF`,
  `2#1111_0000`, `BYTE#2#1111_0000` and the second half of `W#16#00FF` were
  each reported as undeclared identifiers, and the surrounding statements
  were misparsed. Literal recognition now covers the full S7-SCL "Notation
  for Constants" grammar: bare `2#`/`8#`/`16#`, spelled-out type prefixes
  (`BOOL#`, `BYTE#`, `WORD#`, `DWORD#`, `INT#`, `DINT#`, `REAL#`, `CHAR#`,
  and the S7-1500 additions) stacked with a radix prefix, signed and quoted
  values, exponent floats (`4e2`, `3.0E+10`), dates, durations with unit
  suffixes, and times of day.
- Consolidated the three drifted copies of that literal-scanning logic into
  one shared module, and added a fixture covering the whole notation grammar
  so it cannot drift again.
- Added a quick fix for `missing-required-pin` that marks a pin optional in
  the instruction registry, individually or all unfilled pins on a call at
  once, for when a pin table was transcribed as required but the parameter
  is not.
- Added a quick fix for `unknown-instruction` that scaffolds a registry entry
  for the call, seeding its pin names from the call site. Scaffolds are
  written as `confidence: shape-only` with every pin optional and no data
  types, so they never assert more than the call site proves.
- Saving in the Instruction Registry Editor now reloads the rule set and
  re-lints open files immediately; previously the change only took effect
  after reloading the window. A `system-types.yaml` save also rebuilds the
  workspace type cache.
- Both registry quick fixes, and the editor opened from their confirmation,
  land directly on the affected entry with the tree expanded to it.
- Fixed the pin **Name** field being unusable in the Instruction Registry
  Editor: a `width: 100%` control rule collapsed it inside the flex header
  row. The field is now labelled alongside **Dir**, and the same header row
  used by Template extra pragmas and system-type members, which had lost its
  flex layout entirely, lays out correctly again.
- Reduced editor save churn: an edited entry re-serialises in the registry's
  own sequence-indent and quote style, so a small change no longer rewrites
  every line of the entry.
- Corrected `GET`/`PUT` in the SCL registry: only the `ADDR_1`/`SD_1` pair is
  required, not `ADDR_2..4`/`SD_2..4`.
- Added the SCL `PEEK`/`POKE` family.

## 0.1.1

- Added a visual Instruction Registry Editor (`S7 Lint: Open Instruction Registry Editor`):
  an interactive Preact-based webview for creating, editing, moving, and deleting
  instruction and system-type entries across the registry's YAML files.
  - Comment- and formatting-preserving YAML document model (only changed entries
    are re-rendered; untouched regions are copied byte-for-byte on save).
  - Schema-driven forms with validation for instruction entries, instance types,
    and system types, including drag-and-drop reordering and cross-file moves.
  - Buffered edits with undo/redo and atomic save (temp file, validate, replace).
- Added detection and handling for instance DATA_BLOCKs (`instanceOf`/
  `instructionName`), including instance-type context checking that flags
  instance types used outside a `FUNCTION_BLOCK` (`instance-type-illegal-context`).
- Fixed dotted member completion for quoted external block references
  (`"Some_DB".`), including instance DATA_BLOCKs and instructions.
- Added a quick fix and auto-create-on-accept completion for dotting into a
  bare FUNCTION_BLOCK type (`dot-access-needs-instance`): both generate the
  needed instance and repoint the reference at it in one action.
- Fixed the SCL/LAD-FBD file-language loader to route by content prefix
  instead of an `-SCL.yaml` filename suffix, eliminating false diagnostics.
- Fixed root-level completion suggestions incorrectly appearing inside a
  `BEGIN ... END_*` executable body.
