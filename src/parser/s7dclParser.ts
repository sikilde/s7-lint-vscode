// SINGLE bare operand/literal/nested-call, never a real operator tree (see
// PinArg's own comment: "real operator type-inference this parser doesn't
// do"). The functions below are the first one: a small precedence-climbing
// parser over `+ - * / MOD`, `AND OR XOR`, the six comparison operators,
// and unary `NOT`/`-`, built PEEK-ONLY (never calling `cur.next()`) so it
// can run inside `parseSclBody`'s own per-token loop without disturbing it
// -- same "peek-only helper alongside the main consuming loop" convention
// `peekOperandRefChain`/`peekSimpleCondition` already established, just
// generalized to a real operator tree instead of one fixed shape.
//
// Scope: ONLY a plain SCL assignment's RHS (`#lhs := <expr>;`) is parsed
// this way (see `parseSclBody`'s own hook for where). A "call" leaf here
// is limited to the bare `Ident(args...)` shape (the shape every explicit
// conversion function like INT_TO_REAL always has) -- an instance-dot
// call's `result.kind` is always `none` per system-registry/result.yaml
// anyway, so it could never legally appear as an operand in an arithmetic
// expression, and isn't worth the parser complexity of also recognizing
// `#Instance.Name(...)`/`#Instance(...)` shapes here.
// `endLine`/`endCol` mark the position immediately AFTER this node's own
// last token (1-based, same convention as `line`/`col`) -- e.g. for
// `binary`, the end of `right`, NOT of the operator `line`/`col` marks the
// start of. Lets a caller (see linter/exprTypeChecks.ts's
// `expr-implicit-numeric-conversion` Quick Fix) build an exact
// `vscode.Range` for a sub-expression without re-deriving it from raw
// text -- every node already computes this from `nextOffset`/the last
// token it actually consumed, so it's always precise even across a
// multi-line expression.
